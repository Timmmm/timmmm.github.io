<p>I like Youtube. I quite like <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/@TomScottGo">Tom Scott</a>, but I don‚Äôt
like his tendency to use clickbait titles. A recent video was
particularly bad:</p>
<p><img src="2022-12-21-20-22-27.png" /></p>
<p>What is this video about? The title gives no clue. Most of his videos
aren‚Äôt nearly as bad as is but he is still one of the worst offender
among my Youtube subscriptions. Here are a couple of milder - but still
annoying - examples:</p>
<p><img src="2022-12-21-20-24-12.png" /> <img
src="2022-12-21-20-25-24.png" /></p>
<p>Contrast this with <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/@scottmanley">Scott Manley‚Äôs
videos</a>:</p>
<p><img src="2022-12-21-20-56-20.png" /> <img
src="2022-12-21-20-57-12.png" /></p>
<p>It‚Äôs also pretty annoying everyone on Youtube uses the thumbnail as an
opportunity to dollop on an extra clod of clickbait. There is an
extension called <a
href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clickbait-remover-for-you/omoinegiohhgbikclijaniebjpkeopip">Clickbait
Remover for Youtube</a> that turns the thumbnails back into frames from
the actual video, but that‚Äôs all it does. It can remove some clickbait
but it can‚Äôt add a proper title back.</p>
<p>That got me wondering - <strong>could ChatGPT create a new,
non-clickbait title?</strong> Most videos have some information in the
description, and you can download captions too. Here‚Äôs my first
experiment using the ‚ÄúI was wrong‚Äù video:</p>

---- BEGIN TRANSCRIPT ----

Almost two years ago, I made a video about fire marks.
Back in the 18th century,
firefighters in London were funded by insurance companies.
When you insured a building, you would be given a fire mark,
a big plaque to put on the front
And if a fire ever broke out,
all the various companies&#39; firefighters would rush to the scene.
and the story goes that they would look at the building,
and only fight the fire if they saw their company&#39;s mark,
or the mark of a company that they had an agreement with.
&quot;If the building wasn&#39;t insured, they would let it burn.&quot;
This is a really well-known story in Britain,
it&#39;s part of the standard &#39;history of the fire brigades&#39;.
Panel show QI has talked about it.

<p>Daaaamn. I know there‚Äôs been a lot of criticism about how ChatGPT is
a master bullshitter and therefore cannot be relied upon when you need
actual truth. But there are plenty of applications where it doesn‚Äôt
really matter if it bullshits a bit. This feels like magic and I think
it‚Äôs going to change a <em>lot</em> of industries (in about 10 years
when a cheap enough API is available).</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs try a few more. I‚Äôm going to give it the original clickbait
title and ask for a non-clickbait one. It probably understands what
clickbait is, since it‚Äôs a very linguistic thing. First the clean energy

The Bay of Fundy in eastern Canada has the highest tides in the world,
anything up to 16 metres difference between low tide and high tide.
And the effects of that show up in a few places around here.
Like Hopewell Rocks, where I&#39;m not standing on a beach right now,
I&#39;m standing on the ocean floor.
That&#39;s how far the tide is out.
Actually, I&#39;m kind of sinking into it.
But in a few hours&#39; time,
those rocks will be half-way underwater,
and if I stuck around,
I would be drowning in very cold, very fast and very deep ocean.
But I&#39;m not going to do that!
Instead, I&#39;m going to go about 40km that way, to--
--Moncton. It&#39;s the next morning, it&#39;s very cold,

<p>Not perfect - it doesn‚Äôt indicate that there‚Äôs some problem with
harnessing the tides - but it‚Äôs pretty damn good! To be fair none of the
information we gave it really told it what the problem with harnessing
the tides is. I wonder if it can do better with the full transcript. I
am unsure how much context ChatGPT can handle but it‚Äôs a short video so
let‚Äôs try it! With the full transcript I‚Äôd guess it doesn‚Äôt need the
original title or description.</p>

than what I paid for a two-year subscription.
Plus, being in Canada, some British sites
keep trying to be helpful and automatically redirect me to .ca domains,
or even occasionally say that I can‚Äôt access them at all
because I‚Äôm not a local.
Now I can say my phone or laptop are in the UK,
or any one of about sixty other countries if I want,
and a lot of stuff just works for me.
On my laptop and my phone,
up to six devices at the same time if I wanted.

TRIUMF&#39;s Rabbit Line, on the University of British Columbia campus, sends slightly radioactive material under the streets of Vancouver at 100km/h (60mph). Here&#39;s how and why. ‚óæ More: https://www.triumf.ca/headlines/curre...

---- BEGIN TRANSCRIPT ----

- Under the streets of Vancouver,
at the University of British Columbia,
there are pneumatic tubes 2¬Ω kilometers long
that use air pressure to transport slightly radioactive stuff
underground from a particle accelerator to a hospital.
The tubes are called the Rabbit Line
and the only sign of them from the surface
is a few manholes, and some little studs in the ground
to mark the path.
Most of the students and staff here at UBC have no idea
that a few times every day, underneath their feet,
capsules with radioactive stuff speed by at up to 100 kilometers an hour.
So, we&#39;re going to start at the particle accelerator here
and explain how: how the stuff&#39;s made and how it&#39;s sent.
And then, at the receiving end, at the hospital,
we&#39;re going to explain why.

<p>Ok so they‚Äôre not the most creative titles but I‚Äôm amazed at how
ChatGPT enables applications that would have been impossible only one or
two years ago, and the effort required to implement them using ChatGPT
is approximately zero.</p>
<p>I won‚Äôt be writing any <em>Clickbait Fixer for Youtube</em>
extensions any time soon because ChatGPT has no API, but I hope you
enjoyed this glimpse of the future.</p>
